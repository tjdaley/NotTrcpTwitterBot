1,"TRCP's purpose is fair adjudication under the law, liberally construed for efficiency. ",94
2,"TRCPs govern most courts but do not supersede the old ""lunacy"" laws.",75
3,"Don't get hung up on verb tense, pronoun gender, or plural vs. singular.",79
3a,Local rules are allowed but cannot make life worse than these rules do.,79
4,"Time periods don't count the first day but do count the last day. Short periods do not include weekends, long periods do.",128
5,Courts can extend deadlines but not their own plenary power. Postmark prior to deadline with receipt w/in 10 days of deadline satisfies the deadline.,156
6,"Cannot file most suits or serve process on Sunday, but citation by publication, which is a scam anyway, can be done on Sunday.",133
7,People can represent themselves or hire attorneys. Attorneys can appear for their clients.,97
8,The attorney in charge is the attorney whose name appears first on a pleading or who is later designated as being in charge.,131
9,Only two attorneys can speak for you at trial unless your case is important or the judge wants to hear from someone else.,128
10,"If an attorney wants to quit, that attorney must get the judge's permission via a written motion. The judge can impose conditions on the withdrawal. NB: Send the motion to your client first class mail **AND** certified mail. PS. Check local rules--they might help you.",276
11,"If you have an agreement you want the court to enforce, get it in writing and file it with the court (best) or get it on the record in open court (sloppy). Otherwise, it's just talk. Rf TRCP 1: What constitutes a writing may not be all that formal so be careful!",270
12,"If you swear that you believe opposing counsel is acting without client authority, upon 10 days' notice, he must show up and prove his authority to act. Upon his failure to do so, the court MUST strike the pleadings unless another attorney appears and shows authority.",276
13,"Before you sign a pleading, you have the duty of reasonable inquiry that it is not based on nonsense. Bringing a ""test"" suit or a nonsense suit is contemptable (jail) and sanctionable. NB: Bringing a baseless request for sanctions under this rule is just as bad.",270
14,"When they have knowledge of the facts, attorneys and agents can make affidavits on behalf of their clients or principals. It's not the status as agent or attorney that supports this rule, it's the personal knowledge of the agent or attorney. (Rf. Cantu v Holiday Inns)",276
14b,"The court's clerk must file and keep exhibits offered OR admitted as per the Supreme Court's rules, which say nothing about throwing away exhibits immediately after an interlocutory hearing.",199
14c,"If you are required to post a surety bond and the judge trusts you, you can deliver a check drawn on a charted, insured bank instead of arranging for a bond. You'll earn interest on it, unless you fail and must forfeit  your bond.",239

16,"Whoever serves papers on someone has to make a note of the date and time they received the paperwork, how, when and where they served the papers, and send those notes back to the court clerk on a copy of the service page.",229
17,A process server must serve papers without waiting to get paid first.,77
18,"Even after a judge dies, becomes disabled, or resigns, the show can, must, and will go on.",98
18a,"A party can ask for a new judge (See TRCP 18b for reasons). You should ask as soon as you know of the basis for your request. Do it right--you only get three strikes. Be smart--if you do this just to delay or otherwise screw with the system, you may be sanctioned.",273
18b,"If a reasonable person, knowing all the facts in the public domain concerning the judge's conduct and relationships, would have a reasonable doubt that the judge is actually impartial, there is probably a basis to disqualify or recuse the judge. (Rf Drake v Walker)",274
18c,"A judge can permit live-streaming and filming of courtroom proceedings if the Supreme Court allows it, or the parties and each witness agree, or if it's a ceremonial proceeding.",186
19,"Other than in Armstong and Harris County's, district court terms begin on the first Mondays in January and July, no matter what day that is and whether the judge is actually there. No ceremony is required. (See Tx. Govt Code 24.012)",240

21a,"When you start a suit, you have to personally serve the party you are suing. After that, you can serve their attorney. A person served by mail gets an extra three days to act. KEEP YOUR PROOF OF SERVICE. (Tip: PDF the e-file envelope details and keep with your pleading.)",280
21b,"We're serious about following rules 21 and 21a. If you don't follow them, you can be sanctioned. See, TRCP 215.2(b) for a list of sanctions. They're tough.",164
21c,"Some facts are sensitive, e.g. a Social Security number. Unless the sensitive datum is required, you must redact it before filing. If you are not permitted to redact, then you must warn the district clerk. Only 3 people in TX understand this rule.",256
22,"If you want to sue someone, you have to file a written petition asking the judge to take some action.",109
23,"When you file your suit, the clerk has to assign the next consecutive file number to it. No UUIDs. Just sequential numbers. This becomes important later. (E.G. TRCP 27)",176

26,The clerk's registry of actions and a note of the court's ruling is must be kept as a PERMANENT RECORD.,111
27,"""The cases shall be placed on the docket as they are filed."" Sure, but they won't be heard, settled or resolved in that order. (Some rules pre-date aggressive discovery and motion practice: Attorneys just filed suits, set them for trial, and ambushed each other.)",271
28,"You can file a suit using your DBA (trade name), but if one the the folks you're suing asks for it, your true name may [?] be substituted for the DBA.",158
29,"Dissolving your company will not protect you or it from being sued (unless a wind-down receiver has been appointed). An aggrieved party can sue the officers, directors, or others in controll just before dissolution and get a judgment on the pre-dissolution assets.",272
30,"Case law is more clear on this one: If you sign a note as maker, the payee may sue you and get a judgment without joining the co-makers. (Reed v Buck) If you want the co-makers to share in the downside of the suit, you better join them yourself.",253
31,"You can't sue an insurance company unless you also sue the insured party. Yes, some rules are clearly meant to protect insurance companies. Several rules are more easily understood of you view them as that way. What do you think TRE 408 is for?",252
32,A surety (person who takes responsibility for another's performance) who is being sued along with a party to a contract can ask that the question of the existance or validity of the surety be tried first. IOW: Am I *REALLY* responsible for his performance?,264
33,"If you sue or are sued by political or administrative subdivision of the State, that suit has to identify the subdivision by corporate name. (Can't be Big D v Tom, although it feels that way sometimes.)",210

35,"If the State or one of its subdivision sues a government official or a depository, the official's or depository's or sureties and bonds may be joined as defendants until the court can sort out who is liable.",215
36,"If one state official's bond is sued, the sureties of any subordinate state office who is alleged to contributed to the plaintiff's damages can also be brought in as defendants.",185

38,"If a defendant believes that others are at least partially liable to the plaintiff or to the defendant for damages, the defendant can add those others to the case and sue them as defendants. Here, defendants also means counterdefendants.",245
39,"If a third party is required for just resolution of a case and is amenable to service, that party shall be joined and, if not, the judge must decide whether the case can continue.",187
40,People claiming a right to relief arising from the same wrong can join their claims to existing claims if they want to. All people who may be liable for the same wrong may be joind as defendants.,203
41,"Parties and claims can be joined at any time before the case is submitted to the jury. Likewise, any misjoined parties or claims can be redocketed as separate suits. In other words, the judge can fix joinder and mis-joinder problems until very late in the game.",269
42(a),"A member of a class of plaintiffs may sue as representatives of the class if there are (1) too many class members for joinder and (2) common questions of law OR fact among all class members, and the representatives will adequately protect the class members.",268
42(b),"A class action can proceed if a plaintiff satisfies 42(a) AND separate suits would lead to inconsistent results, or a decision for one is as good as a decision for all, or the defendant his equally offended all members of the class, etc.",248
42(c),"Early on, the judge must either certify the class by defining the class, claims, and defendants, or refuse to certify the class and explain why, in detail.",166
42(d),"Classes can be subdivided into subclasses, which each subclass treated as a class under TRCP 42.",107

42(f),Unnamed members of a class are not considered parties for discovery purposes.,88

42(h) and (i),"The judge approves attorney's fees based on a ""lodestar"" figure, which is the number of hours reasonably worked times an hourly rate. The fees must be 25% to 400% of the lodestar and have the same cash:non-cash ratio as the settlement to the class members.",275

44,"Children and other lunatics, idiots, or incompetents who don't have legal guardians can be represented by ""next friend"". Ex: A parent can bring a SAPCR on behalf of a minor child who has also become a parent.",216
45,"A  lawsuit is underway once the plaintiff files a petition giving a concise statement of claims and the defendant files an answer. The substance of pleadings prevails over their form: Read the pleading, not the heading.",227
46,What went wrong in Texas that we must have a rule that says the petition must be one single document and the answer must be one single document?,152
47,"The original pleading must breifly state the cause of action sufficient to give fair notice of what the suit is about and the damages sought. Except for family cases, the statement on damages must state that damages sought are within a certain set of ranges.",266

50,Claims and defenses must be made in separately numbered paragraphs.,75

52,"An allegation that a corporation is incorporated shall be taken as true, UNLESS denied by the affidavit of the adverse party explaining how the corporation was formed.",175
53,"If you're suing on a private law or special act, reference it by its title, date of approval, and then provide as much substance of it as is pertinent to this suit. (Divorces used by be granted by private law of the legislature, thus the old term ""Bill of Divorce."")",274
54,"Alleging that ""all conditions precedent have been met"" is sufficient and you only need to prove the satisfaction of the conditions precedent that the opposing party denies.",180
55,"In announcing its judgment, the court need only state that it has jurisdiction without going into all the details proving that the court has jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter of the suit.",214
56,"Special damages are damages that ""result naturally, but not necessarily, from the defdant's wrongfl acts."" (Arthur Andersen v Perry) A party claiming special damages must specifically explain what they are.",214

58,"Statements in a pleading may be adopted by reference in other documents so long as the underlying pleading has not been superseded. In these days of electronic cut and paste, and, by ""these days"" I means days since 1984, why make everyone flip back to a prior pleading?",277
59,All written instruments constituting a claim sued on or supporting a defense may be attached to or included in the body of the pleading. A pleading is not defective because it does not raise a claim that is available in the exhibit. No other writings may be attached.,275
59 (again),"So family attorneys: Stop attaching pictures of the other parent drunk and naked on the floor. Those are evidence, not explanations. No one needs to see it and it might form the basis of a motion to strike your pleading. Don't be gross.",252
60,"Anyone can intervene at any time before final judgment. Intervenors may be sticken by the judge for sufficient cause on the motion of a party unless the intervenor can show a justiciable interest, meaning an independent right to recover.",245
61,The rules of pleading apply equally to original parties and intervenors. This rule exists because someone thought otherwise. Interesting.,145
62,Distinguishes between amended pleadings and supplemental pleadings. An amendment adds something to or withdraws something from a pleading or answer.,156
63,"Parties can amend at any time so long as they do so in a manner that is not designed to cause surprise to the other side. Amending within 7 days of trial requires permission from the judge, who shall give permission unless the amendment will surprise the other side.",274
64,"When filing amended pleadings, use a proper header that indicates the ordinal rank of the amendment. Also, the amended pleading must be self-contained. Don't just file the amended paragraph: file the entire pleading.",224
65,"Once a substituted pleading is filed, unless sticken for some reason, the prior pleading is of no further consequence, unless there is a limitations issue that can only be resolved by reference to the date or substance of the superseded pleading.",254
66,"If a party objects that the other side is seeking relief outside of their pleadings, the court must allow an amendment to the pleadings unless the objecting party can explain how that would be unjust. The court may continue the case as needed.",251
67,"If issues outside of the pleadings are tried by consent, the issues shall be treated as if they were in the pleadings and the scope-creeping party may amend to include those issues if the judge allows it",211
68,The court may require a party to replead so that their pleadings conform to the rules.,94
69,"Supplemental petitions or answers shall respond to the last pleading by the other party and must not repeat more than is necessary to explain the supplement. Supplements must be named ordinally, e.g. First, Second, Third.",229
